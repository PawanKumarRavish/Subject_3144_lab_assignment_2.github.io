                <p>This 73-meter high tower was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak
                    in the year 1193. Built after the defeat of Delhiâ€™s
                    last Hindu ruler, the Qutub Minar was constructed to
                    celebrate the Muslim supremacy in Delhi.
                    It is the highest tower in India, with five
                    levels and projecting balconies. The first three
                    levels are made up of red sandstone and the last
                    two of marble and sandstone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Qutub Minar has three different types of architectural
                    styles. The construction of the minar was started by Aibak
                    (who only made the basement). Later, Iltutmish added on
                    three stories and then it was completed by Firoz Shah
                    Tuglak, who constructed the last two stories.
                    Quwwat-us-Islam Mosque, the first mosque ever to be built
                    in India, is situated here.</p>

                        Delhi is a city with an impressive and remarkable
                        history. Standing as a witness to this interesting
                        bygone era are the various monuments of Delhi. From
                        the Old Fort to the Tughlaqabad area to the
                        various tombs in the city, each one represents
                        a separate period in the history of Delhi.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the area of New Delhi, historical monuments
                        cover mostly those that were built during the
                        time of the British like the Parliament House,
                        President's House, the India Gate etc.

                        However, one thing that is common in all the monuments of
                        Delhi is their architectural excellence. Be it the Red Fort
                        built by Shah Jahan or the Parliament House designed by Edwin
                        Lutyens,</p>
                    <p> each and every monument has an architectural beauty
                        that leaves you mesmerized. All said and done, the
                        magnificence of Delhi monuments cannot be fully described
                        and you will have to visit them to really appreciate them
                    </p>
