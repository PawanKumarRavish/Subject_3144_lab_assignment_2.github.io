          <p>One of the best tourist locations in New Delhi, India Gate is a war memorial that the British established
            in the honor of the Indian soldiers who died fighting for them in World War I. It was established in
            February 1931. It was designed and developed by Edwin Lutyens, setting the imperial European architecture on
            our countryâ€™s soil.</p>
            <p>The British fought World War I by recruiting our soldiers. This war tore apart the countries involved in
            terms of lives and the economy. It was the colonial rulers like the British who got immense help from India
            and utilized its resources to win the war. Despite the win, India lost many sons in these four years of the
            gruesome war. Injuries and illnesses wreaked havoc in the armies posted in different parts of the world. So
            many lives were lost fighting the enemies. Even if the countries reached peace and signed a treaty, the
            lives lost could not be returned. It was the respect that the British Empire paid by erecting a monument to
            commemorate 13,300 martyrs. India Gate is the perfect epitome of such memories that so many families went
            through during World War I.</p>
          <p>The architectural design of this gate makes the presentation even better. It took almost a decade to build
            this memoir. Edwin Lutyens was the prime architect of this monument. He was also the frontline member of the
            grave and memorial development team of the British Empire. This edifice is 42 m tall and 9.1 m wide. The
            entire structure is made of yellow and red granite and sandstone. The triumphal arch is the prime element of
            its design. The internal dome is made to accommodate fire burned during any important occasions held by the
            British; its main design was inspired by the brilliant architecture of Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile located
            in Paris, France. </p>
