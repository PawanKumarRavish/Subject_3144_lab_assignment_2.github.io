                <p>This monument embraces the utmost significance in Modern Indian History. It is made of Red
                    Sandstone alone.
                    Sited in central Delhi it was placed where the Mughal emperors lived for many periods. Red Fort
                    was a
                    magnificent castle coated with precious jewels but the Britishers looted these precious jewels
                    during their
                    empowerment over India. </p>
                <p>Since Delhi was the capital of India until the British men shifted it, Red Fort was the control
                    place for
                    the whole nation. Built on the banks of Yamuna River, the walls of this magnificence fort have
                    been built
                    from 30 meters high Sandstone. It is supposed that Red Fort was made after 9 years of hard work
                    of numerous
                    masons for day and night during all seasons.</p>
                <p>The architecture of Red Fort is amazing and appreciable for its creations of five centuries ago
                    without any
                    modern-day technologies and methodologies. It is built with typical Mughal art and view. It has
                    a Dewan-e-Am
                    which is courtroom for all. The king held a hearing from common men about their complaints.

                    The Red Fort is built right beside the Fort of Islam Shah Suri, namely- Shalimar Fort. He built
                    it in 1546
                    as his fortified Palace. Both the forts are combined together by a water channel, namely- Stream
                    of
                    Paradise, or Nahr-i-Behisht. </p>
                <p>Red Fort is not only a building but a true witness of the national movement of Indian freedom.
                    Thus, it is
                    a symbol of the great and golden history of India. So the Indian republic, as well as every
                    citizen of
                    India, have great affection and respect towards the Red fort. Undoubtedly it will always be a
                    symbol of
                    great Indian history. Also, it holds a special place in Indian history because Jawaharlal Nehru
                    announced
                    the independence of India from Red Fort. </p>
